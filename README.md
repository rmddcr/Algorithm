Question:
Simplex Algorithm Assignment

11:55 PMSCS2101 Data Structures and Algorithms III
Submit a complete programme in C/C++ which computes the solution (using Simplex Algorithm) when a standard form of a Linear Programming Problem is given.
Consider the inputs to the algorithms as A, b, c, m, n as discussed in the lecture (variables of the standard form).
Therefore,
A is a matrix, float A[m][n] where m is the number of rows/constraints and n is the number of columns/variables.
b is a vector, float b[m]
c is a vector, float c[n]
Output of the programme should be a vector x which contains the the values of for each variable at the solution. Therefore, output would be a float x[n].

Please submit a single zip file which contains your complete source code. It is better if you can write the source code in a single c/c++ source file. Please provide proper guidelines on how to compile your code and how to run, and if there are any limitations/requirements/platform.
You are allowed to use  math.h/cmath.h headers and any other C/C++ standard libraries and standard template libraries.

Following  four (04) conditions are necessary (yet not sufficient) for attaining full marks for the assignment:
Source code compiles and runs without problems.
Guidelines describe how to change parameters properly.
Guidelines describe any limitations of the programme.
Clear and properly commented source code.
Zero marks are given for the assignment if any of following four (04) conditions apply:
Use of any third party libraries other than C/C++ standard libraries and standard template libraries.
If your code is corrupted/erroneous or if it does not open/run/compile.
You have not submitted guidelines/instructions for either compiling, running  the code is not given.
A guideline given (any of all above) for the assignment is ignored.
